### Foundations
Due to its age, COBOL has some idiosyncrasies.
1. It adheres to English-like grammar syntax, so things such as verbs, paragraphs, sentences, statements, and so on are applied to the language, which makes the reserved list of words quite long.
2. It adheres to a format used when punch cards were a thing, so it has a format that is considered archaic and is not needed anymore.
3. It has plenty of backwards compatibility, but that means that some elements, when used, make it difficult to write good programs
